Cndarray is a preprocessor that makes using n-dimensional arrays in C more pleasant.
It will turn this code::

    void dgemm(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n)
    {
      dimension "fortran" a[n, n];
      dimension "fortran" b[n, n];
      dimension c[n, n];

      for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++i)
        {
          float tmp = 0;

          for (int k = 1; k <= n; ++k)
            tmp += a[i,k]*b[k,j];

          c[i-1,j-1] = tmp;
        }
    }

into this::

    void dgemm(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n)
    {
      for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++i)
      {
        float tmp = 0;
        for (int k = 1; k <= n; ++k)
          tmp += a[((k - 1) * ((n - 1) + 1)) + (i - 1)] * b[((j - 1) * ((n - 1) + 1)) + (k - 1)];

        c[((i - 1) * n) + (j - 1)] = tmp;
      }
    }

It understands all of C99. 

Each axis specification in a `dimension` statement has the following form::

    start:end:stride:leading_dimension

`start` may be omitted. `end` and `stride` may also be omitted, but if entries
afte them are to be specified, their colons must remain in place. For example,
the axis specification `:5` simply specifies a stride of 5. The stride simply
acts as a multiplier on the index.  No plausibility checking whatsoever is done
on the dimension statement.  You may shoot yourself in the foot any way you
like.

If the layout is given as `"c"` or not given at all, the following things are true:

* The array is laid out in row-major order.
* The `end` index is taken to be exclusive, if specified.
* The `start` index defaults to 0.

If the layout is given as `"fortran"`, the following things are true:

* The array is laid out in column-major order.
* The `end` index is taken to be inclusive, if specified.
* The `start` index defaults to 1.

Installation
------------

In the source tree, simply run::

    $ python setup.py install

Note that you may either need to be root or use 
`virtualenv <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_
for this to work.

Cndarray is not completely done and a few details are still subject to change.
For now, you can get it from `github <http://github.com/inducer/cndarray>`_.

Usage
-----

Once installed, simply run::

    $ cnd source.c

Observe that Cndarray expects preprocessed source, for now.

Future Features
---------------

* Syntax for stack and heap allocation.
* Run a C preprocessor on the input.
* Act as a frontend to the C compiler.
